"I should visit my thinking spot," decided the fluffy bear. And out of his bed, Winnie flew, quickly gathering his things and marching off to his thinking spot.  "What a blustery day today is," he chuckled happily.\nAs soon as Winnie reached his spot, he quickly sat down and tried to think of something. "Think, think," Pooh whispered. So, Pooh thought and thought, but nothing came to mind. As little Pooh was busy thinking, Gopher, the beaver suddenly popped out of the ground. "If I were you, I would quickly go back home. It\u2019s Windsday, you know?"','One day, a scorpion looked around at the mountain where he lived and decided that he wanted a change. So he set out on a journey through the forests and hills. He climbed over rocks and under vines and kept going until he reached a river.\nThe river was wide and swift, and the scorpion stopped to reconsider the situation. He couldn\'t see any way across. So he ran upriver and then checked downriver, all the while thinking that he might have to turn back.\nSuddenly, he saw a frog sitting in the rushes by the bank of the stream on the other side of the river. He decided to ask the frog for help getting across the stream.\n"Hellooo Mr. Frog!" called the scorpion across the water, "Would you be so kind as to give me a ride on your back across the river?"\n"Well now, Mr. Scorpion! How do I know that if I try to help you, you wont try to kill me?" asked the frog hesitantly.\n"Because," the scorpion replied, "If I try to kill you, then I would die too, for you see I cannot swim!"\n','Now this seemed to make sense to the frog. But he asked. "What about when I get close to the bank? You could still try to kill me and get back to the shore!"\n"This is true," agreed the scorpion, "But then I wouldn\'t be able to get to the other side of the river!"\n"Alright then...how do I know you wont just wait till we get to the other side and THEN kill me?" said the frog.\n"Ahh...," crooned the scorpion, "Because you see, once you\'ve taken me to the other side of this river, I will be so grateful for your help, that it would hardly be fair to reward you with death, now would it?!"\n','So the frog agreed to take the scorpion across the river. He swam over to the bank and settled himself near the mud to pick up his passenger. The scorpion crawled onto the frog\'s back, his sharp claws prickling into the frog\'s soft hide, and the frog slid into the river. The muddy water swirled around them, but the frog stayed near the surface so the scorpion would not drown. He kicked strongly through the first half of the stream, his flippers paddling wildly against the current.\nHalfway across the river, the frog suddenly felt a sharp sting in his back and, out of the corner of his eye, saw the scorpion remove his stinger from the frog\'s back. A deadening numbness began to creep into his limbs.\n"You fool!" croaked the frog, "Now we shall both die! Why on earth did you do that?"\nThe scorpion shrugged, and did a little jig on the drownings frog\'s back.\n"I could not help myself. It is my nature."\nThen they both sank into the muddy waters of the swiftly flowing river.',"A spectre is haunting Europe \u2014 the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.\r\nWhere is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?\r\nTwo things result from this fact:\r\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.\r\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.\r\nTo this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.","DMOJ contests really need to stop being made by Olympiad students. It's just people who learn the same algorithm and put that on the contest. People like these are the ones with the inflated ratings who just use what they learned from Olympiads.

I turned on the news (only sound now because of all the bullet holes in the screen) and the weatherman said to expect 3-5 inches of lead today. Great, that\'s less than usual. I grabbed a fresh gun out of the cabinet and began to eat my cereal with the spoon attachment that the lax laws in the US allow me to have, but first, I notice my neighbor is outside! We exchange pleasantries and fire. I can hear a heavy machine gun rattling off a few houses down. "Sounds like Jim\'s got the .50 Cal out." I say.\r\n\r\n"Yep", replies my neighbor, "he always trims the hedges on Friday. God bless him and America" we give each other parting shots as we dive into the trenches that lead back into our bullet-riddled home. Out in front I can hear a cop killing someone\'s dog. Which is strange because usually by this time of day theyve already shot everyone\'s dogs. Ah well, I just hope today isn\'t another "designated workplace shooting day" at work.
